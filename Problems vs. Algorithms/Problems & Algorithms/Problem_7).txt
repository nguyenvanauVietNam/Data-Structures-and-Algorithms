Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
HTTPRouter using a Trie
For this exercise we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure we learned previously.

There are many different implementations of HTTP Routers such as regular expressions or simple string matching, but the Trie is an excellent and very efficient data structure for this purpose.

The purpose of an HTTP Router is to take a URL path like "/", "/about", or "/blog/2019-01-15/my-awesome-blog-post" and figure out what content to return. In a dynamic web server, the content will often come from a block of code called a handler.

First we need to implement a slightly different Trie than the one we used for autocomplete. Instead of simple words the Trie will contain a part of the http path at each node, building from the root node /

In addition to a path though, we need to know which function will handle the http request. In a real router we would probably pass an instance of a class like Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler which would be responsible for handling requests to that path. For the sake of simplicity we will just use a string that we can print out to ensure we got the right handler

We could split the path into letters similar to how we did the autocomplete Trie, but this would result in a Trie with a very large number of nodes and lengthy traversals if we have a lot of pages on our site. A more sensible way to split things would be on the parts of the path that are separated by slashes ("/"). A Trie with a single path entry of: "/about/me" would look like:

(root, None) -> ("about", None) -> ("me", "About Me handler")

We can also simplify our RouteTrie a bit by excluding the suffixes method and the endOfWord property on RouteTrieNodes. We really just need to insert and find nodes, and if a RouteTrieNode is not a leaf node, it won't have a handler which is fine.


Ananlysis:
Analyze the complexity of the algorithm in the provided code:
1.	RouteTrie:
	•	__init__: This method has a time complexity of O(1) because it only creates a RouteTrieNode object and assigns it to the root node.
	•	insert: This method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the path. During insertion, we have to iterate through each element in the path and create child nodes if they don't exist.
	•	find: This method also has a time complexity of O(n) because we have to traverse through each element in the path to search on the Trie tree.
	•	split_path: This method has a time complexity of O(n) as well because it needs to split the path into individual components.
2.	RouteTrieNode:
	•	__init__: This method has a time complexity of O(1) because it only initializes an empty dictionary and a handler.
3.	Router:
	•	__init__: This method has a time complexity of O(1) because it only creates a RouteTrie object and assigns it to the root of the Trie tree. The complexity also depends on initializing the not_found_handler, but this doesn't significantly increase the complexity.
	•	add_handler: This method has a time complexity of O(n), similar to the insert method in RouteTrie.
	•	lookup: This method has a time complexity of O(n), similar to the find method in RouteTrie.
	•	split_path: This method has a time complexity of O(n), similar to the split_path method in RouteTrie.
In summary, the complexity of the system depends on the length of the path (n) and the number of elements in the Trie tree that have been added. The search time is O(n), where n is the length of the path. If there are N paths added, the worst-case search complexity is O(N).
